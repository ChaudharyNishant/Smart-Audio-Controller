# Smart-Audio-Controller
This project controls the audio of your system using the gestures you make.

It takes in the video input or pre-recorded video and controls the audio of the Windows using the gestures. If you raise the right hand parallel to the ground towards your right, volume increases and if left hand is raised, volume is decreased. Raise both the hands at the same time to mute the system.

The camera should not move during the recording or live webcam video and the first frame should only consist the background and not the person.

[nircmd](http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/nircmd.html) is used to run the command to change the volume.
